# social-force-model-with-destination-choice

Code for agent-based pedestrian flow simulation.  
The agents move according to Social Force Model (SFM).  
The destination on SFM is often given and fixed, but in this implementation, the agent makes a choice.   
Destination selection is based on a discrete choice model.   
The distance to the destination and the movements of other pedestrians are taken into account when selecting a destination.

# Example
The agents move from left to right, and select one of two destinations (exits).
